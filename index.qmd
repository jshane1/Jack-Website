I'm a [Predoctoral Research Fellow at SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/programs/predoctoral-research-fellowship-opportunities) where I work with Professor [Laurence Baker](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/laurence_c_baker) and Professor [Eric Sun](https://profiles.stanford.edu/eric-sun) on Health Economics.

I graduated from Haverford College in 2022, where I majored in Economics and Mathematics, and completed enough Political Science courses for a major if I had written a thesis. My senior thesis was [The Effects of Communication on a Middle Equilibrium in Prisoner's Dilemma](/gabe_sekeres_thesis.pdf).

My research interests are Political Economy theory, specifically using game theory to analyze institutions and those who staff them. I'm currently working on a project about plea bargains under closed-file _Brady_&nbsp; regimes. I'm always down to talk about it, so feel free to reach out!

In my free time, I enjoy watching long video essays and taking pictures of bugs on 35mm film.
