The only useful resource I have here is the graduate school advice I looked at to get a sense of what classes I should take now.\n\nSusan Athey’s Advice\nAlvin Christian’s Advice\nFor more grad school specific advice look here.\nThe most helpful places will be looking at the university that you are interested in and seeing if they have information about ‘ideal’ candidates in their application sections. Some are more explicit than others with respect to expected classes etc.\nAlex Albright’s Thesis Advice\n\n\nMy Setup\n\nThings I use everyday\n\nGitHub to implement version control with your code.\n\nI use Tower (included in Student Developer Pack) to make interacting with GitHub less icky.\n\nIf you use Overleaf set up Dropbox integration.\n\nI prefer Texifier (better UI). Can edit documents through Dropbox so it also updates on Overleaf.\n\nZotero for citation management.\nThere’s a lot of value in listening to your essays before you submit them. I use Kurzweil 300 (provided through my college’s disability office) to do so.\nGoodNotes (enable some kind of syncing so you don’t risk losing your notes)\nI prefer the simplicity of Obsidian over Notion\nPrivacy Badger\n1Password\nLibby (app). Borrow free audiobooks from your library! Really nice UI.\n\nPortable ergonomic equipment (good for hand/arm pain)\n\nNextstand (h/t Nic)\nMicrosoft Sculpt or Kyria\nLogitech MX Master 3"

    "text": "Hi! thanks for visitng my site. I’ve tried to compile some resources for students interested in pursuing economics as predoc and more generally in post-secondary education in my resources page. Here, I’ll talk a little bit about myself.\nI’m a predoc at Stanford, where I’m working on a medical debt relief project with Neale Mahoney. I’m interested in health economics, public finance, and household finance.\nWhen I’m not working, I powerlift (which I’ve been doing one and off for the past 3 years). I also donate blood with the Stanford Blood Center as often as I am eligible and would encourage anyone who is eligible to consider doing so as well. Being a consistent donor can be especially helpful for patients who receive frequent blood transfusions and need a good match on antibodies outside of (A, B, O, Rh +/-).\nI attended Wellesley College, a historically women’s college, where I majored in economics and math. At Wellesley, I explored cs, sociology, and philosophy before landing on econ and math."
